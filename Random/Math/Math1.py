# this is some math stuffs

#from __future__ import division

# division
print 5/2
print 5//2

# These answers are the same - they should be different - why is that? ... Further research is needed
# the first is Floating point division, and the other is floor division, sometimes also called integer division.

# Let's try something else
#from __future__ import division
print float(5)/2

#now we get the correct value for the maths unless we want to import division
